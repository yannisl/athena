\chapter{Designing Chapters}

\section{Introduction}

For too long, the act of printing something in and of itself has been placed on too high a pedestal. The true value of an object lies in what it says, not its mere existence. And in the case of a book, that value is intrinsically connected to content. The aim of this package is to try and provide a bridge between separating content from presentation.

A new chapter must make a good impression and must give an immediate signal that something different is going to be written. Traditionally chapter openings in LaTeX are an unimpressive and dry event. Our aim is to brighten it up a bit, while keeping true separation of content from presentation.

\section{Package Usage}

To use the package include it just like any other package:

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{book}
\usepackage{chaptersx}
\cxset{style13}
\begin{document}
\chapter{Introduction}
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

The command \cs{cxset} sets the default style for the example to the style defined as \marg{style13}. The package currently offers over 50 styles and numerous keys to manipulate them further.

\section{Chapter opening page}

The standard LaTeX classes offer only two options to either open a chapter on an odd page or at any page. This package offers five alternatives:

\keyval{chapter opening}{\marg{any, left, right, anywhere, ifafter}}{The various keys enable any combination to be used.}

\begin{marglist}
\item [any] Opens a chapter at any page, either verso or recto.
\item [left] Opens a chapter on an even page
\item [right] Opens a chapter on a right page.
\item [anywhere] Opens a chapter at the point where the \cs{chapter} is typed.
\item [none] Alias for \marg{anywhere}.
\item [ifafter] Opens a chapter at the next page if the page has material that does not exceed a certain portion of \cs{textheight}.
\end{marglist}

To change a setting you just modify the value of the key \option{chapter opening} to one of the values described earlier.

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
\cxset{chapter opening=anywhere}
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}

\@specialfalse
\cxset{chapter toc=false}
\begin{texexample}{title=Inline Chapter Example}{ex:anywhere}
\cxset{chapter opening=anywhere, chapter before=\bigskip, chapter font-family=\sffamily,title font-family=\sffamily}

\lipsum[2]
\chapter{Chapter Example}
\lipsum[3]
\chapter{Another Chapter Example}
\lipsum[4]
\end{texexample}

\addtocounter{chapter}{-2}

Examples for other types of chapter openings follow in the rest of the documentation.

\subsection{Blank pages before chapters}
In the standard LaTeX book class when the openany option is not given or in the report class when the openright is given, chapters start at odd-numbered pages. This can cause a blank page to be printed. Some book designers prefer this page to be completely empty, without any headers or footers. This cannot be done with \lstinline{\thispagestyle} as this command will have to be issued on the \textit{previous} page. However by a suitable redefinition of the
\lstinline{\clearpage} this can be done automatically.
\medskip

\begin{tcolorbox}
\begin{lstlisting}
\makeatletter
\def\cleardoublepage{\clearpage\if@twoside\ifodd\c@page\else
  \hbox{}
  \vspace*{\fill}
  \begin{center}
    This page left intentionally blank.
  \end{center}
  \vspace{\fill}
  \thispagestyle{empty}
  \newpage
  \if@twocolumn\hbox{}\newpage\fi\fi\fi}
\makeatother
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tcolorbox}
\medskip

This is achieved easily by setting the following options:
\bigskip

\begin{tcolorbox}
\lstinline{chapter blank page=empty}\par
\lstinline{chapter blank page text=Some text.}\par
\lstinline{chapter blank page=plain}\par
\end{tcolorbox}
\medskip

The last one refers to a \lstinline!\thispagestyle{plain}!.

\section{Keys for chapter head formatting}

A chapter heading can be considered of being constructed of several parts, the \textit{chapter number}, the chapter name typically \textit{chapter} and the \textit{title}. Predefined keys handle all the elements of formatting. Additional keys are defined to handle other elements such as inclusion of images or producing complicated examples with graphics constructed with TikZ or other similar packages.

\medskip

\keyval{chapter numbering font-size}{\oarg{sizing commands}}{}.
\keyval{chapter numbering font-family}{\oarg{sizing commands}}{}.

\subsection{Keys for numbering}
Chapter numbering follows that of the standard \LaTeX\ classes and is extended to cover some additional cases such as fully spelled out numbers.

\keyval{number numbering}{\oarg{alph,Alph,roman,Roman,none,WORDS,words}}{Style of numbering.}
\medskip

\parindent1.5em

Note that the package uses Heiko Oberdiek's package alphalph to allow for alphabetic numbering that extends beyond the normal 26 letters of the alphabet. Examples for numbering can be seen in \ref{ex:romannumbering}

\medskip

\begin{marglist}
\item [arabic] Despite that the Arabs call what the West calls Arabic numbers Indian numbers, we provide the value arabic to have normal numbers printed.
\item [alph] Lowercase alphabetic numbering.
\item [Alph] Uppercase alphabetic numbering.
\item [roman] Lowercase roman numbering.
\item [Roman] Uppercase roman numbering.
\item [words]
\item [WORDS]
\item [Words] Prints the number in words and capitalizes the first letter, for example the number 21 will be printed as `Twenty One'\footnote{Currently limited to the first hundred numbers}.
\item [none] This is equivalent to using the star version of the command. It does not print any number and does not increment the chapter counter.\footnote{I am ambivalent about this, perhaps it will be better to increment it, as it can give a more general approach.}
\end{marglist}

\cxset{chapter opening=anywhere, numbering=Roman}
\index{chapter design!numbering!roman}
\begin{texexample}{Setting up keys for numbering}{ex:romannumbering}
\cxset{numbering=Roman}
\chapter{Roman numbering}
\end{texexample}

\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}

\clearpage

\index{chapter design!numbering!words}
\begin{texexample}{title=Chapter number in words}{}
\cxset{numbering=WORDS}
\chapter{Literal numbering}
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}


\cxset{numbering=arabic}
\subsection{Setting font information}
\subsection{Letter spacing}

Chapter letter spacing can be achieved using the soul package in a combination with the key spaceout.
\medskip



\keyval{chapter spaceout}{\marg{soul}}{Uses the soul package to space out the lettering of chapter, number or the chapter name.}\par\medskip



The following examples illustrate the usage.

\begin{texexample}{}{}
\cxset{numbering=Roman,
         chapter spaceout=none,
         title spaceout=soul,
         title font-size=\Large,
         title font-family=\rmfamily,
         title font-shape=\scshape}
\chapter{Letter Spacing}
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}

\index{chapter design!labels!letter spacing}
\begin{texexample}{}{} 
\cxset{chapter spaceout=soul,numbering=arabic, title spaceout=soul}
\chapter{Chapter title}
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}

\subsection{Styling the title}

Similarly to the number and chapter styling keys exist for styling the title. We summarize the available standard keys below:
\medskip

  \keyval{chapter title font-family}{\marg{family}}{Selects a predefined font family}
  \keyval{chapter title font-weight}{\marg{\cs{bfseries},\cs{normalseries}}}{Font weight.}
  \keyval{chapter title font-size}{\marg{\cs{large},\cs{Large},\cs{huge},\cs{Huge},\cs{HUGE},\cs{HHuge}}}{Font sizing command.}
  \keyval{chapter title font-color}{}{}
  \keyval{chapter title spaceout}{\marg{soul,none}}{}
%  \keyval{title spaceout}/soul/.code={\@titlespaceouttrue},
%  title spaceout/none/.code={\@titlespaceoutfalse},
%  title font/.style={title font-family=#1},
  \keyval{title before}{}{}
 \keyval{title after}{}{}
  \keyval{title beforeskip}{}{}
  \keyval{title afterskip}{}{}


\begin{texexample}{letter spacing the chapter title block}{}
\cxset{style13, chapter spaceout=none}
\chapter{Chapter Title Styling}
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}


The last example illustrated the use of a predefined style \oarg{style13} and overriding some of the parameters.


\cxset{chapter opening=right}
\section{Table of Contents}\index{table of contents!key settings}

Traditionally a chapter will be added to the Table of Contents if the \cs{chapter} command is issued. The starred version will not produce a number and will not add a contents line. Since we have adopted an approach where we use a key value interface we can dispense with the starred version of the command, by setting the \option{chapter toc} option to false. For example if we want to define a command for a ``Foreward'' or ``Epiloque'' without wishing them to be added to the table of contents we can use the following setting.\index{Foreward!definitions}\index{Epilogue!definitions}

\begin{texexample}{changing the chapter label name}{}
\cxset{chapter toc=false, name=, numbering=none,}
\chapter{Foreward}
\lorem
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}


Please note that when \textbf{numbering=none} the chapter number is not available anymore and yo may have to reset it if required again. Although this might be seen as rather cumbersome than simply using \cs{chapter*} the advantage is consistency in the user interface and the use of appropriate semantic definitions for all sectioning commands thus achieving a bit more separation of context from style.


\cxset{chapter toc=true}

\section{Defining styles}

Named styles can be defined using the standard \textsc{PGF} conventions. To define a style for the forward above we can use:

\begin{texexample}{}{}
\cxset{foreward/.style={chapter toc=false,numbering=none,
          name=,
          title font-size=\Large,
          title font-family=\sffamily,
          numbering=none}}
\cxset{foreward}
\chapter{Foreward}
\lorem
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}

\cxset{numbering=arabic}
\section{Creating semantic names for commands and environments}

To keep our search for semantic commands and true separation of contents it is prudent to define some macros for typesetting the  `foreward' section.

\begin{texexample}{defining a \textit{Foreward} macro.}{}
\cxset{foreward/.style={chapter toc=false,
          name=,
          title font-size=\Large,
          title font-family=\sffamily,
          numbering=none}}
\newcommand\forewardname{foreward}
\expandafter\newenvironment\expandafter{\forewardname}{%
\cxset{foreward}\chapter{Foreward}}%
{}
\begin{foreward}
\lorem
\end{foreward}
\end{texexample}
\addtocounter{chapter}{-1}


Notice the use of a new command \cs{forewardname} to allow for internationlization using Babel or other methods. One is tempted to let the English name, but a better approach perhaps is to define both.

\cxset{numbering=arabic}
