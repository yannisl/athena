\chapter{Introduction to Style 43}

\epigraph{The Jebel Druse is a country of great feudal chiefs, whose efforts are
directed to preserving the powers by which they live.What we call
progress means in their eyes the loss of their privileges and later on
perhaps the partition of their lands.With regard to the inhabitants,
who are ignorant or unmindful of any better fate, they are deeply rooted
in their serfdom and are as conservative as their masters. They have no
aspirations for a system of greater social justice nor [sic] for a better
communal life.}{---Testimony to the League of Nations Permanent Mandates\\
Commission investigating the Syrian Revolt, Geneva, 1926}

\epigraph{Syrians, remember your forefathers, your history, your heroes, your
martyrs, and your national honor. Remember that the hand of God is
with us and that the will of the people is the will of God. Remember
that civilized nations that are united cannot be destroyed.

The imperialists have stolen what is yours. They have laid hands on
the very sources of your wealth and raised barriers and divided your
indivisible homeland. They have separated the nation into religious
sects and states. They have strangled freedom of religion, thought,
conscience, speech, and action.We are no longer even allowed to move
about freely in our own country.

To arms! Let us realize our national aspirations and sacred hopes.

To arms! Confirm the supremacy of the people and the freedom of
the nation.

To arms! Let us free our country from bondage.}{---Excerpt from a rebel manifesto signed\\ by Sultan
al-Atrash and issued on 23 August 1925}

\lettrine{T}his style is reminiscent of the stylistic elements found in Tufte's books with the chapter title set in italics.

I saw this style in the \textit{The Great Syrian Revolution and the Rise of Arab Nationalism} by Michael Provence, published by the University of Texas at Austin (2005). Notably the best part of the first page is taken by epigraphs, but as you can see from the image, the ugly ``This Page intentionally left blank'' is all over the place, perhaps they could have been mover over? The chapter opens on an even page and bear no headers or footers. The large dropcap at the start of the chapter text balances the ragged left elements of the chapter block.
