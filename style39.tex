\chapter{STYLE 39}

This style uses rules to enclose both the chapter name and number as well as the title, which necessarily needs to be rather short.

In the picture it does not look very attractive, but in the actual book it does. My observation is that the rule clearances are a bit tight and if you use this type of layout it is better to experiment until you get them right.
