A classical style chapter style with finely spaced out letters. A number of books spell out the chapter numbers. In general I find this as a good idea as sometimes the numbers don't blend in very well with the design.

This book has different chapters written by different authors and the author's name appear below an ornament. Don't dismiss ornaments as old fashioned as a lot of modern books still use them.

The ornaments I used was from the \texttt{fourier-orns} package. Here is a MWE if you want to experiment with various designs.


\begin{lstlisting}
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fourier-orns}
\begin{document}
\Huge
\textxswup\textxswdown

\decothreeleft\decothreeright
\decofourleft\decofourright
\floweroneleft\floweroneright
\end{document}
\end{lstlisting}

\section{THINGS THAT ARE NOT AUTOMATED}

If you need the title to be spaced out using the soul package and you have a line break, the package will issue the error `reconstruction failed'. In this case it is better to include the spaceout commands in the title.
