# The Athena LaTeX Package#

This is a pre-release version of an opiniated package
that transforms any LaTeX class into a fully flexible typesetting
system by the use of the concept of `styles` as described and
coded by PGF/tikZ.

## Warning ##

The code is still not fully debugged and at this stage is just a proof of
concept.
